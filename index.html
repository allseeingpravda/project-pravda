            <h2>Enter the search for the all-seeing Truth</h2>

            <p>
            Has this ever happened to you? You're watching <i>Miraculous Ladybug</i> with your 6-year-old cousin, and you interpret it as a powerful allegory of courtly love with reversed traditional gender roles. You explain your vision to the kid, and she tells the rest of the family—leading to a series of events where you end up in a psych ward and tracked by the Mossad.
            </p>
             <p>
            Don't worry! Through this website, <b><i>Project PRAVDA</i></b> aims to be a gatescape for the misfit youth, victim of the century of hyperaccessible information. Here, you will join the desperate search for truth through Marxist-Leninist analyses of medieval folk songs, coded animations of biblical prophecies, and more. At PRAVDA, we see truth as a complex accumulation of realms of knowledge and strive to escape the traditional way of teaching that relies on intellectual separation between fields.
             </p>
             <p>
            As Karl Marx said, <i>'Specters of the past walk among us still,'</i> and only by hearing their voices can we begin to build a map of the future.

            <h3><b>Fundraisers</b></h3>
            <i>"An intellectual’s credibility lies not in isolation, but in their willingness to descend into the messy realities of struggle—lending their voice, resources, and labor to collective efforts that demand justice, knowing that theory without action is complicit silence."</i> — Adapted from Antonio Gramsci’s <i><u>Prison Notebooks</u></i> (paraphrased)
